## Gunn Alumni Project
This is a student-led project to create an alumni site for Gunn High School, something that suprisingly does not exist yet

## Setup Instructions For Website
Clone the repo and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gunn-alumni/gunn-alumni.git
cd gunn-alumni
pnpm install
```
Then run the site on localhost:3000

```bash
pnpm run dev
```
